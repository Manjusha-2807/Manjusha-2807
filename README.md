# 🤖 Emotion Robot - Phase 1

Welcome to **Phase 1** of the *Emotion Support Robot* project!  
This stage focuses on building core technical skills (C++, Raspberry Pi, Git) and laying the foundation for a dynamic, AI-powered emotional support companion.

---

## 🚀 Project Goals

- ✅ Strengthen C++ and Raspberry Pi programming fundamentals.
- ✅ Learn version control with Git & GitHub.
- ✅ Implement basic robotics interactions (sensors, output control).
- ✅ Prepare for advanced AI integration in future phases.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repo using SSH:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:Manjusha-2807/emotion-robot-phase1.git
   cd emotion-robot-phase1
2. Build and Run:
   g++ src/hello.cpp -o hello
   ./hello
3. Use push.sh script to commit and push updates:
   ./push.sh


**Current Focus**
 GitHub setup with SSH 
 Hello World in C++
 Sensor-Class C++ Tutorial (Ultrasonic)
 Speaker Integration (Text-to-Speech)
 OLED vs LCD Decision & Display Output

**Phase 1 Roadmap**
“Build strong foundations, not shortcuts.”

🔹 Learn C++ OOP & hardware interaction
🔹 Understand sensor & actuator control
🔹 Maintain clean version history
🔹 Document progress as we grow
